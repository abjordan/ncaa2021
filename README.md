# NCAA Bracket Predictor

Give me a metric per team, and I'll run through all of the NCAA Tournament games for 2021 and help you make your bracket choices.

To customize it, change the `metric` dictionary to have an entry per college and fire away.

As an example, the NCAA-2021.csv file has each of the teams along with their student body's COVID-19 statistics [1] per capita [2].
If you picked a winner based on the lowest incidence of COVID-19 per capita, you'd pick Oral Roberts as the winner, since
they have a (frankly unbelievable) COVID infection rate of *1* per 4160 students.

May the odds be ever in your favor!
